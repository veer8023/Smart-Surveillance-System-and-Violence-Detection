## 🚀 Features

- 🔥 **Violence detection in real-time**
- 🎥 Support for live CCTV or webcam feeds
- 🧠 Deep learning-based action recognition model
- 📦 Modular and scalable codebase
- 💬 Alerts and visual annotations on detected frames
- 🖼️ Save snapshots of suspicious activities

## 🏗️ Tech Stack

- **Python**
- **OpenCV** for video processing
- **TensorFlow** / **Keras** (or PyTorch) for deep learning model
- **NumPy**, **Matplotlib**, and other standard Python libraries

## 💻 How It Works

1️⃣ Capture video frames from a live feed or video file.  
2️⃣ Preprocess frames and extract temporal and spatial features.  
3️⃣ Feed frames into a trained violence detection model.  
4️⃣ Annotate frames with alerts if violence is detected.  
5️⃣ Optionally, save suspicious clips or notify operators.
